I did not have the pole number at that time, but I have it now. It is pole number HY01\n\nThe google map inaccurately shows the location of our house to be back in the middle of block, which is actually the location of our garage/workshop at 79A Edgewood. Our house, at 79 Edgwood, is only a few feet off the street.  Our bedroom window is directly opposite the street light. I am requesting that some sort of shade be put on the light to prevent it from shining directly into my bedroom, which is currently the case.\n\nThanks very much.\nTina Schwartz\ntinaschrand@hotmail.com\n828-258-2844\non 2013-03-15 21:41:55 -0400 commented:\nIs this a joke?

This is a Progress Energy pole and we called them last month to replace the bulb.  We will call them today.  If they do not come to the site by Monday we will contract with an electrician to make the repair.  Please let me know if you see any other issues.  Please also contact our Park Ranger Keith if you witness suspicious or illegal activity in the park.  Keith can be reached at (828) 552-9373.  You can also use the police non-emergency at 252.1112.\nBy Unknown on 2013-03-20 08:15:00 -0400 commented:\nThe light should be replaced by Friday. We have asked for a more secure unit that will protect the bulb from rocks. We are also looking into an LED unit like we have on the streets to provide better security. Thanks for your patience and I apologize again about this unacceptable delay.\nBy Unknown on 2013-03-25 12:01:01 -0400 commented:\nWe just contacted Progres Energy about the issue.  The bulb was changed, but there is a power outage they were not aware of.  They said they would have power restored in three days.\nAlexandra Baker on 2013-03-18 16:39:59 -0400 commented:\nThanks for seeing to this. I have had to call the non emergency  police number quite a few times, but none since it started getting  cold. It will be great to have a working light in time for warmer weather.\nAlexandra Baker on 2013-03-23 13:27:31 -0400 commented:\nI guess you mean this coming Friday the 29th?

        "requesttype": "General Question",
        "description": "Water line next to fire hydrant near intersection of Windsor and Robinhood Roads began leaking in January 2012 (over a year ago). Finally it was repaired in early January one year later, but not before the backhoe used hit a holly tree (now standing at about a 20 degree lean) and a gas line, which  spewed gas and air about 20 feet in the air for two hours.  Two weeks later, the water leak hole was filled in but instead of grading to level out the dirt,  the crew just replaced the dirt with what is now a crater in the middle (great for mosquito breeding in the summer when water collects after a rain), high spots where the fill dirt once was, grass seed dropped onto what was clods of soil, and straw placed on top. The ruts left behind by the backhoe were never leveled or seeded for grass.  The work looked satisfactory at a distance, but up close, what lay underneath was a difference in elevation of over a foot and plenty of dirt clods, some of which are still around. (See photos-nope, this site will only allow one photo-I have more if you need them). I would think that the city, which is trying to hold onto its water system, would have its crews take better care of work sites so that its clients (water customers) would support the city's efforts, not question it. Please return to grade out the site correctly, anchor the holly tree so that it will not fall over, and level out and seed the ruts left behind by the backhoe.",

I hate to carp, but the crosswalk at the Visitors' Center was repainted shortly after Montford was repaved months ago, but it has taken much too long to repaint the crosswalk lines at Tod's. Both crosswalks should -- and could - have been done at the same time. There really isn't any excuse for not having done both crosswalks at the same time. \n\nMy dog and I crossed Montford today at 5 pm -- two out of four cars stopped for us and let us cross; now we just need to educate drivers that it's state law -- not state \"suggestion\" -- to stop for people crossing the road at designated crosswalks."

There is a general ordinance prohibiting solicitation from streets and median strips in the Asheville area.  This is especially significant in the heavy traffic issues we see in the downtown area.  However, the City of Asheville does allow groups to seek permits which will allow those permitted groups to solicit and a popular location is Patton at Louisiana.  Therefore, you need to expect this action to continue.  The best advise I can offer is for you to be selective about  to whom you plan to donate your funds.  Consider only giving to local charities.  Ask who they represent, what their needs are and if the money is going to be used locally.  Some groups come from out of state to solicit and generous residents think they are local and donate without thinking about the groups or what they represent.  I do encourage people to send checks to legitiment organizations and this is so important during our current economic struggles.\non 2013-05-06 11:52:51 -0400 commented:\nU call the cops duhhhh  that is what I do"

If they don't there are at least four more shops in town, just further away from you.  \n\nThe closest is Fast Lane Electric Bikes, 362 Depot Street #202, in the river district. Their phone number is (828) 545-7345, and their website is www.fastlaneebikes.com.   There are two shops on Haywood Rd in West Asheville, ProBikes at 610 Haywood Rd and Second Gear at 444 Haywood Rd.  ProBikes' phone number is (828) 253-2800, and website is www.probikes.com.   Second Gear's phone is (828) 258-0757, and website is www.secondgearwnc.com. They have recently opened a store downtown, but I think they still have the West Asheville store, too.  Hearn's Cycling and Fitness is downtown at 28 Asheland Ave, just south of Patton Ave.  Their phone is 253-4800.  Beer City Bicycles is also downtown at 144 Biltmore Ave, their phone is (828) 575-2453 , and their website is www.beercitybicycles.com. \n\nIf this isn’t what you were looking for, please let me know.\nBarb Mee on 2013-05-06 12:46:47 -0400 commented:\nNote:  I answered Friday night, but see that it shows as a private comment, so I tried again Monday.\nLily Liu on 2013-05-24 16:27:18 -0400 commented:\nWow, this is a wonderful and thorough response.

Simply need a phone number of who to call in the city, zoning, planning, etc?  I am looking to put a doctors office in an appartment building on 15 Grindstaff, near the hospital.  It would change the use, office downstairs, appartments remain upstairs?  Please help!"

It makes it somewhat dangerous when someone forgets to close the outer gate or is walking in with a dog. It would be great if this could be fixed, I don't expect a new gate or anything, just a piece of plywood that swings with the gate attached to the bottom of it would get the job done. Thank you!",

If you wish to review the ordinance go online to Ashevillenc.gov, open Government, open City Codes and ordinances.  This will lead you to the Unified Development Ordinance on the Municord Website.  You will find everything you are asking about under Chapter 10.  I will ask the North District Officers to attempt to locate the source of the complaint but you can file a complaint yourself if you can find out who the hauler is by name.  I do suggest two people make the complaint.  Some private haulers do not think the ordinance applies to them, as Commercial Businesses, but it does.  I encourage you to determine the location of the pickup and the name of the hauler carrier.  With that information you can call the business and ask them to please stop dumping so early.  If they refuse, you can complete the complaint form to get relief.  Recently Richard Grant with Public Works over Sanitation contacted all private haulers and requested them to wait until 7 AM to start their pickups.\ns shoaf on 2013-05-21 09:20:58 -0400 commented:\nI have the same problem.

The Transit Master Plan recommends two buses on Route C which would reduce the frequency to 45 minutes, but we do not have the funding for this at this time.  The traffic and distance of this route make it difficult to reduce it to one hour.\n\nWe continue to seek funding and work to improve the timing and frequency on this route.\n\nRoute C is designed to connect with the four corridors that have twice and hour service: Patton Ave.(W3 & W4), Haywood Rd. (W1 & W2), Biltmore Ave. (S1 & S3) and S. Tunnel Rd. (E1). \n\nWe agree that the 1hr and 15 minute schedule of the Route C makes it difficult to predict, but usually one of these corridors will provide a reliable connection.   \n\nPlease know that we continue to analyze Route C and seek funding to make improvements, as is called for the Transit Master Plan (which can be read at www.ridetheart.com).  We know that more transit service is continually requested by the Asheville community, but funding limits our level of service.\n\nIf you have access to GoogleMaps, the transit trip planner can assist you in figuring out which transfer at which time is most effective.  Go to www.ridetheart.com for instructions on how to use the GoogleMaps transit trip planner.\n\nThank you for your suggestions and please continue to let us know how we can improve.\nYuri Koslen on 2013-06-13 12:45:29 -0400 commented:\nTo Krys Lefler - Where are you traveling from and to?

W1 operates from 5:30am -10pm and W2 operates 6:30pm-7:30pm.\nHave you had problems using the service?  The on-time performance for these two routes is above average.  There are times when traffic and other factors can cause delays, but on Haywood Rd. you have the benefit of two buses between 6:30am - 7pm."

There are a couple of small shrubs that could be moved but, even doing that would not help much. This is also a \"convenient\" location for large delivery trucks to stop and make their deliveries.

I live at the Corner of Beverly Road West and Rivervie Drive and I really enjoy the new Stop Signs the city installed at the corner of Beverly Road West and Riverview Drive, QUESTION #1: Can the city come paint lines were you are supposed to stop and/or put flashing lights on the signs cause I see people on a Daily Basis Just run them completely or just do a rolling stop and it's not like there is NO PRIOR WARNINGS to the new STOP signs cause you guys put them in farther up each road to warn people of the New Traffic Pattern. QUESTION #2: Is there anyway you guys can lower the signs just a little cause they seem to be extremely high up.  QUESTION #3:  You have to pull PAST the stop sign coming from Beverly Road West so you can see whats coming up Riverview drive on your Left. can the city do anything to that corner to cut the bushes/trees back so you can see oncoming traffic, cause I do my best to keep my Bushes and trees in my yard Trimmed/cut some people can see the oncoming traffic from the right. Thank You So Much For your Time. I just found out about this app and I figured I would give it a shot to see how well it works cause I have friends in the Community that love it and say works well.",

I have forwarded all 3 questions to the Traffic Engineer for his follow up.\nJeff Moore on 2013-06-18 09:27:54 -0400 commented:\nThanks for your email.  We will look at the sight distance and see if we can have it trimmed back.  The sight issue was one of the things that made the all-way stop justified.  One of the reasons that we do not paint stop bars on the road at every stop conrolled intersection is that as long as you come to a complete stop, it is then legal to pull forward as far as necessary to be able to see before proceeding through the intersection.  If there is a problem with compliance with the sign. we can paint the bars to make the stop more obvious.  I will pass this along to our Police  Traffic Safety Unit for their enforcement planning.\nWe try to place our stop signs at a standard height of 8 feet, which should be about 5 feet from the ground to the bottom of the sign.  While we do have many signs that vary in height, when we install a new one, we try to put it in according to the standard.  When our crew comes out to paint the stop bars, I will ask them to double check the height.  \nThanks for using our Asheville App!  I am forwarding this to our Technician and our Sign Crew Supervisor.\nHave a great day!\nJeff Moore\nCity Traffic Engineer\nDean Grayson on 2013-07-02 08:47:50 -0400 commented:\nThanks for letting us know we will lower the stop signs as soon as we can.\n\n  Dean\n  Sign shop Supervisor."

It sometimes takes a little time to work through this process, but they will issue a notice of violation and fine if the property is not maintained to ordinance standards.\n\nBuilding Safety checked the property out a year ago and confirmed that it was abandoned but secure - meaning it was boarded and locked so it could not be entered into.

They were smack dab in the crosswalk! I realize it is a delicate balance between the businesses that need supplies, etc, and the need for traffic to pass. We have numerous places downtown where trucks make their deliveries from the travel lane. This usually occurs during the non-peak times, and does not seem to cause any problems. It is not always practical or even possible to have enough loading zones and still have enough parking available for the businesses and shoppers. Blocking the crosswalk would seem to be a violation of Sec. 19-137 (a) (2). I would be happy to participate in a larger conversation about this.

Piney Moiuntain Drive is  a street that we had once proposed for sidewalk, but do not expect to build in the near future.  It does have transit service on the Asheville Reinvents Transit (ART) S-1 bus route.  You can find routes, schedules and other information at www.ridetheart.com.  \n\nThe city makes decisions on what sidewalks we will build based on available funds and needs and crirteria in our pedestrian plan.  The first test is whether a street that is without sidewalk is among the 100+ miles identified in the pedestrian plan as a needed linkage.  Piney Mountain Drive is not a needed linkage.\n\nThe city is undertaking a comprehensive multi-modal transportation plan this year, and I hope you will stay alert for opportunities to be involved in that plan.  I anticipate that the planning effort will affect how we decide what sidewalks to build.\n\nThank you,\n\nBarb Mee\n232-4540\nbmee@ashevillenc.gov\nJames Boone on 2013-07-24 08:39:47 -0400 commented:\nI will forward your request to the appropriate department."

There are piles of brush that we cleared and placed at the end of Arborvale and near the intersection of Houston and Arborvale for the city to pick up this week. The piles are the debris from partially clearing the stop sign at the end of Arborvale and the no turn sign on Houston, near the intersection of Arborvale . We'd like to be sure the city picks those piles of yard waste up, but there's considerably more debris for the city to clear on these issues as well as the traffic mirror on Houston and other stop signs. Be aware that much of the brush at the end of Arborvale is poison ivy on both sides of the road.\non 2013-08-06 13:10:51 -0400 commented:\nThree city employees were here this morning and did a great job clearing the stop signs and one-way street signs around Arborvale/Houston/Courtland.

THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION because Arborvale is a narrow, one-way street with a blind curve and cars parked along one side of the street. People walk their small children and dogs on this street because we do not have sidewalks. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SEVERAL NEAR-MISSES WITH DRIVERS  WHO ARE GOING THE WRONG WAY. I have spoke with the City of Asheville Police Department, who will be glad to enforce the one-way rule WHEN THERE IS AN ACCIDENT. Do we need to have a head-on collision before this problem if fixed? Does a child need to be hit? Does a dog need to be run over? THIS IS AN URGENT PROBLEM THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.",

Today is trash day, so they're weaving between parked cars on one side of the street and trash cans on the other. It's just about time for mothers from Dickson school to drive down the street - in the legal direction - and come face-to-face with other drivers who cannot read one-way road signs.

Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about the vehicles. They are all legal and, while they look junky, the owner was able to demonstrate that they run.\nRussell Roe on 2013-09-13 13:30:02 -0400 commented:\nIgnore my comment from 9/12. I realized when I went out to inspect that I had this confused with another property. This one is definitely in violation of the Sanitation Ordinance and I will issue a warning notice.\nRussell Roe on 2013-10-14 16:47:46 -0400 commented:\nThe junk has been removed from the front of the property. The police have been asked to investigate the junk vehicle problem.\nRussell Roe on 2013-09-26 11:48:30 -0400 commented:\nNotice of Violation issued today to owner Paul Brezny.

We will look into this issue and see what action we can take to resolve it.  Please contact me at jmoore@ashevillenc.gov if you have any questions or concerns.\nJeff Moore on 2013-11-20 16:29:36 -0500 commented:\nWe have looked at Waynesville Avenue with respect to the on street parking.  Our policy is to allow on street parking on a road as long a width can be maintained that will allow for the passage of emergency vehicles.  This is generally considered to be 10 feet.  The width of an on street parking space is 7 feet.  Therefore, if a road is 17 feet in width or greater, we allow parking on one side, and if the road is 24 feet or greater in width, we allow parking on both sides.  The parking is usually self regulating on most of our streets.  If there is a specific location where we are aware that existing parking does not allow for the required width to be maintained, we can restrict parking with signs.  On street parking has been found to be a very effective, low cost traffic calming measure.  There are usually enough gaps left between cars due to driveways, etc, to allow for cars to wait for approaching cars to pass.  Many times, residents have no choice but to park on the street.  Waynesville Avenue has an average width of 18-20 feet.  We have not been made aware of any specific areas where on street parking is causing issues on Waynesville Avenue.  In order to remove parking for the entire length of the road, we would need a large majority of the residents to request the change.  If you have a specific area that you are concerned about, we will be glad to review it and see if a restriction in that area will be effective.\nI regret that I can not answer your request in a more favorable manner. Thanks for your interest in the safety of our roads.\nJeff Moore"

The people who defaced this sign also defaced the sign on the other side of the street which says \"No Parking This Side of the Street.\" I climbed up on the hillside and tore off the duct tape off the sign. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN IMPORTANT STREET SIGNS ARE COVERED UP OR MADE TO SAY SOMETHING INCORRECT.\non 2013-09-30 09:08:33 -0400 commented:\nThis morning, we discovered that someone removed the duct tape covering the words \"No\" on the \"No Parking Sign\" at the bottom of Arborvale Road. We suspect it was the neighbor, in whose house the offenders live because we spoke with him about the issue yesterday afternoon. We'll keep watch on the signs in the future. So please remove this request from the Asheville App. Thanks."
